-  Hi, I’m @UAC-guy
-  I’m interested in coding, gaming, modding, music, and science.
-  I’m currently learning DECORATE, MAPINFO, and ZSCRIPT for GZDoom
-  You can reach me on Discord at UAC guy#8057
-  I am currently working on a partial conversion for GZDoom called "100 Portals to Hell". If you want to play the unfinished(and slightly unplayable) version, use this link:
